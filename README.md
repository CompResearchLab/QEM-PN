# Physics-Aware POD-Based Learning for Ab initio QEM-Galerkin Simulations of Periodic Nanostructures
The code developed by Martin Veresko and Ming-Cheng Cheng uses the QEM-Galerkin Simulation method to compute the wavefunctions and energies for periodic crystal structures and accompanies the paper ????.



The Input.txt file includes all information to set up the simulation. This code be be broken down into 2 main parts: training and verification.
